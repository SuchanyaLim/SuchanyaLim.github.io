The command-line tools for linguists course introduces linguists to working in the command-line. The course goes over command-line basics, text processing, scripting, remote access, and version control.

I highly recommend this course for anyone who needs some guided introduction to command-line magic and text processing workflows!

### Module 1: Introduction to Command Line Environments

As the name says, Module 1 was an introduction to command-line environments. We went over how to set up our command-line environment ([WSL 2 for Windows users!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wDXqM_YjT0&t=1s)) and basic commands for navigating the command-line. We also learned about the Unix file system.

We used commands like `ls` to list files, `cat` and `nano` to view and edit files. We covered file management commands such as `cp` to copy or `mv` to move files, `mkdir` to create directories and `cd` to navigate between them. We also learned about users, groups, and file permissions and using `chmod` to change file read, write, and execute permissions. Finally, we looked at `curl` for downloading text files which we will use for text processing in Module 2.

This week was a good refresher for those who have used the command-line before. It was helpful to have everything explained in context. What I found most helpful was setting up WSL 2 as that had always intimidated me for some reason. I also appreciated the explanation on groups and file permissions.
