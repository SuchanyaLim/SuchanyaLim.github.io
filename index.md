## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> Hi! I'm Suchanya. I'm currently studying Cognitive Science in the Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities Masters at University of Helsinki. I'm interested in Human-Computer Interaction; mainly how cognitive science informs educational technology and instruction design, but also just interaction design in general.
<br> <br> In my free time, I enjoy making things (cooking, knitting), and collecting skills - Learning new things is fun. Recently I've been spending time on some technical projects.
